# CP Legged Robots/Thesis - Quadrupedal Robot Locomotion
My master's thesis focused on developing a comprehensive control system for an 8-DOF legged robot. The project involved designing and finalizing both electronic and mechanical systems, while implementing firmware to handle communication protocols, initialization sequences, and error monitoring. The control system was successfully deployed on an Nvidia Jetson Orin Nano AGX platform.

# CP Legged Robots - Gait Test Platform
As part of my Senior Project at Cal Poly, I designed a specialized testing platform that enabled controlled experimentation with various gaits and gait-switching mechanisms. The platform incorporated a fall prevention system that would safely catch the robot in case of failure, protecting both the hardware and operators while facilitating valuable data collection.

# CP Legged Robots - Single Leg Hopper
I developed a control system simulation for a single-leg hopper constrained to vertical plane movement. This project served as a prototype for control methodologies, which were later adapted and implemented by John Benett in his master's thesis. The simulation demonstrated infinite hopping capabilities within its constrained environment.

# Hunter Industries - Stator Valve
At Hunter Industries, I worked on optimizing a stator-valve design for high-performance sprinklers. The primary focus was improving nozzle pressure by reducing head loss across the valve. My main contribution involved transforming initial prototypes into manufacturable components and developing early tooling solutions.

# Mu-Tron - Micro-Tron IV
For the Micro-Tron IV optical envelope filter pedal, I led an initiative to standardize Mu-Tron's pedal lineup. By implementing a shared motherboard design while maintaining unique effect boards for analog signal processing, we significantly improved inventory management and reduced production lead times.

# Mu-Tron - Biphase II
The Biphase II dual-phaser pedal project involved rapidly transitioning to domestic manufacturing in response to prohibitive Chinese tariffs. I managed the vertical integration effort, including the acquisition and setup of necessary tooling for garage-based production, ensuring business continuity during challenging market conditions.

# Mu-Tron - Opto-Mod
The Opto-Mod project involved developing custom vacdrol chips for guitar pedal applications. These components were designed with various LED/photoresistor combinations, each configuration producing distinctive tonal characteristics in the final audio output.
